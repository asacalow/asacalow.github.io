# Shift Click: Template Project

Welcome! This is a 'bare-bones' HTML/CSS website to get you started on your final project for Shift Click. The aim here is to give you just enough structure to get going without puzzling about how to get the JS, CSS, and HTML all talking to each other properly.

## Getting started

### Step 1: Create your Github repo
You can get started by clicking on 'Use this template' above â€“ this creates a new repository in your own Github account. To host your website with Github Pages you'll need to name this new repository `username.github.io`, replacing `username` with your own Github username.

### Step 2: Open in VS Code
Now that you have a new repo in Github, the next step is to bring this into VS Code so you can work on it locally.

Open a new VS Code Window, by going to `File > New Window` then select the Source Control panel from the menu on the left-hand side. Click on the `Clone Repository` button, copy-paste the URL of your Github repo and hit return, then choose somewhere on your computer to copy the files to.
